Recursion Tree Visualizer
Recursion Tree Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help programmers, students, and educators understand the structure and flow of recursive algorithms. By visualizing recursion trees for user-defined functions in JavaScript, Python, or Go, this project makes it easier to analyze recursion depth, branching, and overlapping subproblems‚Äîkey concepts in both recursion and dynamic programming.

üöÄ Features
Multi-language Support: Visualize recursive functions written in JavaScript, Python, or Go.

Interactive Visualization: See each recursive call as a node in a dynamically generated tree.

Recursion Depth & Complexity: Instantly understand call stack depth and branching factor.

Dynamic Programming Insights: Highlights repeated subproblems, aiding in the transition from naive recursion to optimized DP.

Step-by-Step Animation: Watch the recursion tree build in real time, with logs for each call.

Modern Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + TypeScript

Backend: Node.js with sandboxed execution

Visualization: Reingold-Tilford algorithm for tidy tree layouts

üßë‚Äçüíª My Learning & Contributions
As someone passionate about algorithms and code quality, I explored and documented this project to deepen my understanding of:

How recursion trees are generated and visualized programmatically

Tracking and logging recursive calls for educational clarity

The use of advanced layout algorithms (like Reingold-Tilford) for clean, readable tree structures

Best practices in code modularity and documentation

I have added additional comments and documentation, and clarified usage instructions to make it even more accessible for learners and fellow developers.

üìö Usage
Input your recursive function in JavaScript, Python, or Go.

Run the visualizer: the backend executes your code in a safe, sandboxed environment and logs each recursive call.

Explore the generated recursion tree interactively‚Äîzoom, pan, and step through each call to see how the algorithm unfolds.

üìù Acknowledgements
This project is based on the outstanding work by brpapa/recursion-tree-visualizer.
I have studied, documented, and adapted the codebase to further my understanding of recursion, dynamic programming, and algorithm visualization.

üí° Why This Project?
Recursion and dynamic programming can be challenging to master. Visualizing the call structure not only aids in debugging but also builds intuition for optimizing algorithms‚Äîa skill I am actively developing through resources like Aditya Verma‚Äôs dynamic programming playlist.
