# üìä Recursion Tree Visualizer

**Recursion Tree Visualizer** is an interactive educational tool designed to help programmers, students, and educators **visualize and understand recursive algorithms**. By dynamically generating recursion trees for user-defined functions in **JavaScript**, **Python**, or **Go**, this tool makes it easier to analyze **recursion depth**, **branching**, and **overlapping subproblems** ‚Äî key concepts in recursion and dynamic programming (DP).

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Language Support**  
  Visualize recursive functions written in **JavaScript**, **Python**, or **Go**.

- **Interactive Recursion Trees**  
  Each recursive call appears as a node in a dynamically generated tree. Explore the tree with **zoom** and **pan**.

- **Call Stack Depth & Branching Factor**  
  Instantly observe recursion depth and the branching structure of your algorithm.

- **Dynamic Programming Insights**  
  Repeated subproblems are automatically highlighted ‚Äî helping users transition from naive recursion to optimized DP solutions.

- **Step-by-Step Animation**  
  Watch your recursion tree build in real-time, with detailed logs for every recursive call.

- **Clean & Tidy Tree Layouts**  
  Uses the **Reingold-Tilford algorithm** for clear, readable tree structures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js (sandboxed code execution for safety)  
- **Visualization:** Reingold-Tilford algorithm for tree layout

## üíª How to Use

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Input** your recursive function (JavaScript, Python, or Go) into the tool.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run** the visualizer ‚Äî your code executes securely in a sandboxed environment, and every recursive call is logged.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore** the generated recursion tree interactively. Zoom, pan, and step through each call to see your algorithm in action.

## üßë‚Äçüíª My Contributions & Learning

Driven by my passion for algorithms, recursion, and code quality, I studied and enhanced this project to:

- Understand **programmatic generation and visualization of recursion trees**
- Learn how to **track, log, and present recursive calls** for educational clarity
- Explore advanced **tree layout algorithms** like Reingold-Tilford
- Apply **best practices** in code modularity, documentation, and developer experience

‚û° I contributed additional documentation, comments, and clearer usage instructions to make the project more accessible for learners and developers.

## üí° Why This Project?

Recursion and dynamic programming are often challenging concepts. By **visualizing the structure of recursive calls**, this tool helps users:

- Build intuition for recursion flow and call stack behavior
- Identify repeated subproblems for dynamic programming
- Debug and optimize recursive algorithms

I‚Äôm actively strengthening my skills in these areas through hands-on exploration and learning resources such as **Aditya Verma‚Äôs dynamic programming playlist**.
